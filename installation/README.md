# Flutter Setup

To set up the flutter in your system you can go through the [official doc](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) or steps that we provided down below. 

## Installation
To setup flutter, you need:
* Android Studio
* Xcode (In mac devices)
* git
* Google chrome (Planing to do flutter web)
* Flutter SDK

## Android Installation

Download android studio from the [official website](https://developer.android.com/studio). (For linux user you can also install it from store or snapstore).

After you install android studio open it and click next. You will get a prompt to choose SDK and the required package need to be installed. Agree on all of it and press finish.

Android studio will start downloading all of your required SDK and tools. Please make sure that your internet connection is stable. The time taken to install these tools will take up to 5 - 20 min (Depending on internet speed and system).

If you are using a low spec device it will not be a problem in most cases because we will be not running anything on android studio. We are just using android studio to install the required tools.

After installation we recommend you, open SDK manager from the more action button.

We recommend you install the SDK you want before setting up the flutter. So that, when you are running the flutter for the 1st time the time taken, will be decreased because we already have the SDK.

Now choose the SDK tool and then choose the hide obsolete package. Mark the android SDK command-line tool and install it.
